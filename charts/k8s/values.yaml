# If this does not match, you won't be able to create services within the vcluster. You can find out
# the service cidr of the host cluster by creating a service with a not allowed ClusterIP in the host cluster.
# This will yield an error message in the form of: 
# The Service "faulty-service" is invalid: spec.clusterIP: Invalid value: "1.1.1.1": provided IP is not in the valid range. The range of valid IPs is 10.96.0.0/12
