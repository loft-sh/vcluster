## Applying manifests on initialization
Starting in version 0.8.0, vcluster allows users to apply manifests as soon as a virtual cluster is started. This can be useful for users configuring internal vcluster resources. These manifests are applied before applying the helm charts.

This can be configured via `helm` values:

```yaml
init:
  manifests: |-
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    ...
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    ...
```

## Applying charts on vcluster initialization
vcluster now supports applying helm charts while initializing a new vcluster. Currently 2 methods of applying charts are supported:
1. [Upstream Mode](#upstream-mode)
2. [Bundle Mode](#bundle-mode)

### Upstream Mode
This is the most straight forward approach of applying a helm chart existing in and public/private upstream chart repository. The following examples demonstrate the usage:
```
init:
  helm:
    # public chart
    - chart:
        name: cert-manager
        repo: https://charts.jetstack.io
        version: v1.8.0
      # optional field
      values: |-
        installCRDs: true
      release:
        name: cert-manager
        namespace: cert-manager
    # private chart
    - chart:
        name: my-chart
        repo: https://<address/to/private/repo>
        version: <chart version>
        username: <username_for_private_repo>
        password: <password_for_private_repo>
      release:
        name: my-release
        namespace: my-release-namespace
```

### Chart Bundle Mode
If you're interested in applying a local chart directory, or a chart pulled from a repo that exists locally as a `tar` archive, then bundle mode can come handy. Let's say we have a chart named `my-chart.tar.gz` in the current directory, we can use the bundle mode to deploy it during vcluster initialization as follows:
```
# copy the chart to your clipboard
cat my-chart.tar.gz | base64 | pbcopy
```

Next we can paste the bundle in our values file:
```
init:
  helm:
    - bundle: <base64_encoded_tar_bundle>
      values: |-
        foo: bar
      release:
        name: my-release
        namespace: my-namespace
```
