Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by
a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach
sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the
first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects,
at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this
flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.
Default is false
