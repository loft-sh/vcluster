###### `restartPolicy` <span className="config-field-required" data-required="false">required</span> <span className="config-field-type">string</span> <span className="config-field-default"></span> <span className="config-field-enum"></span> {#controlPlane-distro-k8s-etcd-restartPolicy}

RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
this init container will be continually restarted on
exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
completed.
