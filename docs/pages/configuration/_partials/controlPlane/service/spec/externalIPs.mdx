externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster
will also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed by
Kubernetes.  The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives
at a node with this IP.  A common example is external load-balancers
that are not part of the Kubernetes system.
