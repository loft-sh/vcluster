Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer.
This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying
the loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created.
This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.
Deprecated: This field was under-specified and its meaning varies across implementations.
Using it is non-portable and it may not support dual-stack.
Users are encouraged to use implementation-specific annotations when available.
