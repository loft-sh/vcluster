InternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
receive on the ClusterIP. If set to "Local", the proxy will assume that pods
only want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod,
dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,
"Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly
(possibly modified by topology and other features).
