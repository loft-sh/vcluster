IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to this
service. This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster
configuration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specified
manually, the requested family is available in the cluster,
and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of
the service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allows
for adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allow
changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are "IPv4"
and "IPv6".  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP,
NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to "headless" services.
This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.

This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, in
either order).  These families must correspond to the values of the
clusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are
governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.
