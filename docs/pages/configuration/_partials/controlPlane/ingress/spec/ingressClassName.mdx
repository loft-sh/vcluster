ingressClassName is the name of an IngressClass cluster resource. Ingress
controller implementations use this field to know whether they should be
serving this Ingress resource, by a transitive connection
(controller -&gt; IngressClass -&gt; Ingress resource). Although the
`kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation (simple constant name) was never
formally defined, it was widely supported by Ingress controllers to create
a direct binding between Ingress controller and Ingress resources. Newly
created Ingress resources should prefer using the field. However, even
though the annotation is officially deprecated, for backwards compatibility
reasons, ingress controllers should still honor that annotation if present.
