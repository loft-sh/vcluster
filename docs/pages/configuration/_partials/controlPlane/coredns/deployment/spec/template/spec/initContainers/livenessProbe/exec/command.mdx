Command is the command line to execute inside the container, the working directory for the
command  is root ('/') in the container's filesystem. The command is simply exec'd, it is
not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions ('|', etc) won't work. To use
a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell.
Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy.
