######### `minDomains` <span className="config-field-required" data-required="false">required</span> <span className="config-field-type">integer</span> <span className="config-field-default"></span> <span className="config-field-enum"></span> {#controlPlane-coredns-deployment-spec-template-spec-topologySpreadConstraints-minDomains}

MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
this value has no effect on scheduling.
As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
Valid values are integers greater than 0.
When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
|  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
it will violate MaxSkew.

This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
