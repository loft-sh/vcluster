######## `hostUsers` <span className="config-field-required" data-required="false">required</span> <span className="config-field-type">boolean</span> <span className="config-field-default">false</span> <span className="config-field-enum"></span> {#controlPlane-coredns-deployment-spec-template-spec-hostUsers}

Use the host's user namespace.
Optional: Default to true.
If set to true or not present, the pod will be run in the host user namespace, useful
for when the pod needs a feature only available to the host user namespace, such as
loading a kernel module with CAP_SYS_MODULE.
When set to false, a new userns is created for the pod. Setting false is useful for
mitigating container breakout vulnerabilities even allowing users to run their
containers as root without actually having root privileges on the host.
This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the UserNamespacesSupport feature.
