NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector
when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.
- Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.

If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.
This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
