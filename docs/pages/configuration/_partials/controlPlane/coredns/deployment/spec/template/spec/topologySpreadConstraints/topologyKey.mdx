TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
We consider each &lt;key, value&gt; as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
of pods into each bucket.
We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.
It's a required field.
