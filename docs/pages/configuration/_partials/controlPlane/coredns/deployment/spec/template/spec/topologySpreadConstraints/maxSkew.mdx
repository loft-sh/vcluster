MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
In this case, the global minimum is 1.
| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
|  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
- if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
violate MaxSkew(1).
- if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
to topologies that satisfy it.
It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
