If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then
the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this
reference is removed.
See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/garbage-collection/#foreground-deletion
for how the garbage collector interacts with this field and enforces the foreground deletion.
Defaults to false.
To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner,
otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.
