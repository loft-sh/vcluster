CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was
created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations.
Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.

Populated by the system.
Read-only.
Null for lists.

DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
resource is fully terminated.
If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.
Read-only.

List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have
been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller,
then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true.
There cannot be more than one managing controller.

ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields
that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal
housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or
understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a
controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like
"ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the
workflow used when modifying the object.
