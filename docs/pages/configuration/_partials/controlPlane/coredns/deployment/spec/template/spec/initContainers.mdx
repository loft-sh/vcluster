List of initialization containers belonging to the pod.
Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
unique among all containers.
Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
in a similar fashion.
Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.
Cannot be updated.
