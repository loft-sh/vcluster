PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
or until the termination grace period is reached.
