The maximum time in seconds for a deployment to make progress before it
is considered to be failed. The deployment controller will continue to
process failed deployments and a condition with a ProgressDeadlineExceeded
reason will be surfaced in the deployment status. Note that progress will
not be estimated during the time a deployment is paused. Defaults to 600s.
