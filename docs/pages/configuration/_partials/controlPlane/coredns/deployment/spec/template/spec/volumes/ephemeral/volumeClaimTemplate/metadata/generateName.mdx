GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique
name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided.
If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different
than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.
The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field,
and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409.

Applied only if Name is not specified.
