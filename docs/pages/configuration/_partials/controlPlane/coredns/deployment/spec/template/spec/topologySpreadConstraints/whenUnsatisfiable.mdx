WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
the spread constraint.
- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
  skew.
A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
"MaxSkew" on some topology.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
| P P P |   P   |   P   |
If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
won't make it *more* imbalanced.
It's a required field.
