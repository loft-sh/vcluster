clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned
randomly. If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as per
system configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to the
service; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may not
be changed through updates unless the type field is also being changed
to ExternalName (which requires this field to be blank) or the type
field is being changed from ExternalName (in which case this field may
optionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid values are "None",
empty string (""), or a valid IP address. Setting this to "None" makes a
"headless service" (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpoint
connections are preferred and proxying is not required.  Only applies to
types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specified
when creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. This
field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.
