type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
"ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
than a virtual IP.
"NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
"LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
(if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
as the clusterIP.
"ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.
