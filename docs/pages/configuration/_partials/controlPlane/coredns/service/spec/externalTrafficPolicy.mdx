externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts,
ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
when picking a node.
