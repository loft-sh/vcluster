The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is
NodePort or LoadBalancer.  Usually assigned by the system. If a value is
specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the
operation will fail.  If not specified, a port will be allocated if this
Service requires one.  If this field is specified when creating a
Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be
wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type
from NodePort to ClusterIP).
