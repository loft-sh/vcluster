healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service.
This only applies when type is set to LoadBalancer and
externalTrafficPolicy is set to Local. If a value is specified, is
in-range, and is not in use, it will be used.  If not specified, a value
will be automatically allocated.  External systems (e.g. load-balancers)
can use this port to determine if a given node holds endpoints for this
service or not.  If this field is specified when creating a Service
which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped
when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type).
This field cannot be updated once set.
