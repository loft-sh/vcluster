NonResourceURLs is a set of partial urls that a user should have access to.  *s are allowed, but only as the full, final step in the path
Since non-resource URLs are not namespaced, this field is only applicable for ClusterRoles referenced from a ClusterRoleBinding.
Rules can either apply to API resources (such as "pods" or "secrets") or non-resource URL paths (such as "/api"),  but not both.
