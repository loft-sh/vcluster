ObjectSelector decides whether to run the webhook based on if the
object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both
the oldObject and newObject that would be sent to the webhook, and
is considered to match if either object matches the selector. A null
object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of
delete) or an object that cannot have labels (like a
DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to
match.
Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end
users may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels.
Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.
