matchPolicy defines how the "rules" list is used to match incoming requests.
Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent".

- Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule.
For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,
but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`,
a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the webhook.

- Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version.
For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,
and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`,
a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the webhook.

Defaults to "Equivalent"
