Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook cares about.
The webhook cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule.
However, in order to prevent ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks
from putting the cluster in a state which cannot be recovered from without completely
disabling the plugin, ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are never called
on admission requests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects.
