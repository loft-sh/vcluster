###### `url` <span className="config-field-required" data-required="false">required</span> <span className="config-field-type">string</span> <span className="config-field-default"></span> <span className="config-field-enum"></span> {#policies-admissionControl-mutatingWebhooks-clientConfig-url}

`url` gives the location of the webhook, in standard URL form
(`scheme://host:port/path`). Exactly one of `url` or `service`
must be specified.

The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use
the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external
DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve
in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may
also be an IP address.

Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is
risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts
which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this
webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy
to turn up in a new cluster.

The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".

A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in
a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the
webhook, for example, a cluster identifier.

Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not
allowed. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not
allowed, either.
