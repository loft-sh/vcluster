SideEffects states whether this webhook has side effects.
Acceptable values are: None, NoneOnDryRun (webhooks created via v1beta1 may also specify Some or Unknown).
Webhooks with side effects MUST implement a reconciliation system, since a request may be
rejected by a future step in the admission chain and the side effects therefore need to be undone.
Requests with the dryRun attribute will be auto-rejected if they match a webhook with
sideEffects == Unknown or Some.
