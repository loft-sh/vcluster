title: Synced Resources
sidebar_label: Synced Resources
---

This section lists all resources that can be synced or mirrored by vcluster currently in the table below. Those resources can be activated or deactivated via the `values.yaml` as described below, or with the `--sync` flag of the syncer. By default, certain resources are already activated and you can either disable the default resources or tell vcluster to sync other supported resources as well.

| Resource               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Default Enabled |

_\* refer to the description column for claryfying information about default behavior._

By default, vcluster runs with a minimal set of RBAC permissions to allow execution in restricted environments. Certain resources require extra permissions, which will be automatically given to the vcluster ServiceAccount if you enable the resource sync with the associated helm value.

## Enable or disable synced resources

To enable a resource syncronization, for example persistent volumes, and automatically create the necessary RBAC permissions, add the following to your `values.yaml`:
```
sync:
  persistentvolumes:
    enabled: true
```
then create or upgrade the vcluster with:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster --upgrade -f values.yaml
```

To disable a resource that is synced by default, for example if you don't want to sync services, set the following in your `values.yaml`: 
```
sync:
  services:
    enabled: false
```
then create or upgrade the vcluster with:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster --upgrade -f values.yaml
```

:::warning Correct Cluster Functionality
Disabling certain resources such as services, endpoints or pods can lead to a non-functional virtual Kubernetes cluster, so be careful with what resources you are deactivating. 
:::

## Extra Pod Options

By default [ephemeral containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/) and [readiness gates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-readiness-gate) will not be synced by vcluster, as they require additional permissions. To enable those, please activate those within your values.yaml:

```
sync:
  pods:
    enabled: true
    # Sync ephemeralContainers to host cluster
    ephemeralContainers: true
    # Sync readiness gates to host cluster
    status: true
```

## Sync other resources

Syncing other resources such as deployments, statefulsets and namespaces is usually not needed as those just control lower level resources and since those lower level resources are synced the cluster can function correctly. 

However, there might be cases though where custom syncing of resources might be needed or beneficial. In order to accomplish this, vcluster provides an [SDK](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster-sdk) to develop your own resource syncers as plugins. To find out more, please take a look at the [plugins documentation](../plugins/overview.mdx).

### Generic sync
Besides the plugins, vcluster provides a way to define additional resources that should be synced in a generic and declarative way with just a few lines of a YAML configuration. This feature is a successor to the [vcluster-generic-crd-sync-plugin](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster-generic-crd-sync-plugin) project and is included since v0.14.0 release. The full range of the generic sync features is available only in the vcluster created in the "multi-namespace mode", see the ["Multi-namespace mode" chapter](#multi-namespace-mode) for details.

You will need to declare which CRD Kinds you would like to sync from the virtual cluster to the host cluster, or vice versa, and the vcluster will automatically copy the CRD definition from the host cluster into vcluster at the start. Then it will take care of watching the resources of the predefined Kinds and execute the synchronization logic based on the configuration provided to it. The vcluster may automatically transform the resource metadata(such as name, namespace, labels, etc.) as is common for resources synced by vcluster. In addition to the implicit metadata transformations, you can configure transformations that will be performed on other fields of the resource, and these will depend on the meaning of those fields. You may also declare which fields will be copied in the opposite direction, from the synced resource to the original one. 
Many controllers create Kubernetes resources as a result of custom resources, for example, cert-manager creates Secrets based on Certificate custom resources, and this feature will allow you to sync these resources from the host cluster into the virtual one. The following chapters describe the configuration options in more detail.

:::tip
You may find configuration examples in the ["generic-sync-examples" folder in the vcluster repo](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/tree/main/generic-sync-examples).
:::

:::warning Alpha feature
Generic sync feature is currently in an alpha state. This is an advanced feature that requires more permissions in the host cluster, and as a result, it can potentially cause significant disruption in the host cluster.

#### Configuration syntax
The helm values snippet below shows an example of the generic sync configuration and related RBAC roles. There you can notice some key fields nested under `.sync.generic` value:
- the RBAC namespaced `role` and cluster scoped `clusterRole` required for the plugin - these would be adjusted to fit the needs of your use case and the configuration that you define. Note that when the ["Multi-namespace mode"](#multi-namespace-mode) is used, the namespaced role will become ClusterRole.
- the `config` field, which will populate the `CONFIG` environment variable of the vcluster syncer container - this must be a string with valid YAML formatting. It uses a custom syntax to define the behavior of the plugin. 

```yaml 
sync:
  generic:
    clusterRole:
      extraRules:
        - apiGroups: ["apiextensions.k8s.io"]
          resources: ["customresourcedefinitions"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
    role:
      extraRules:
        # Example for Cert Manager
        - apiGroups: ["cert-manager.io"]
          resources: ["issuers", "certificates", "certificaterequests"]
          verbs: ["create", "delete", "patch", "update", "get", "list", "watch"]
    config: |-
      version: v1beta1
      export:
      # ...
```


#### Virtual to Host sync
We use the top-level `export` field in the configuration to declare which virtual resources we want to sync to the host cluster. Each item in the `export` array defines the resource via `apiVersion` and `kind` strings. Each `apiVersion` and `kind` pair can have only one entry in the `export` array. The `patches` field allows you to define how are certain fields of the synced resource modified before its creation(or update) in the host cluster.   
The `reversePatches` field allows you to declare how changes to certain fields(implicitly this is done for the `status`) of the synced resource(the one created in the host cluster) are propagated back to the original resource in the virtual cluster. Besides the status, only the fields referenced in the `copyFromObject` reverse patch operations are propagated.
Both these fields follow the same syntax, as documented in [the "Patch syntax" chapter of this doc](#patch-syntax).


Example:
```yaml
sync:
  generic:
    config: |-
      version: v1beta1
      export:
        - apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
          kind: Certificate
          patches:
            - op: rewriteName
              path: spec.issuerRef.name
            - op: rewriteName
              path: spec.secretName
          reversePatches:
            # Implicit reverse patch for status would be declared like so:
            # - op: copyFromObject
            #   fromPath: status
            #   path: status
```

**Selector for a generic Virtual to Host sync**  
You can limit which resources will be synced from the virtual cluster by configuring the `selector` array. The virtual resource is synced when it matches one or more selectors, or when the `selector` field is empty. Supported selector types are:  
`labelSelector` - the `key: value` map of the resource labels. All of the defined label key and values should match on the resource in the virtual cluster to be synced. Example:
```yaml 
sync:
  generic:
    config: |-
      version: v1beta1
      export:
        - apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
          kind: Certificate
          selector: 
            - labelSelector: 
              - "label-key": "label-value"
```


#### Host to Virtual sync
We use the top-level `import` field in the configuration to declare which host resources we want to sync to the virtual cluster. Each item in the `import` array defines the resource via `apiVersion` and `kind` strings. Each `apiVersion` and `kind` pair can have only one entry in the `import` array. The `patches` field allows you to define how are certain fields of the synced resource modified before its creation(or update) in the virtual cluster.   
The `reversePatches` field allows you to declare how changes to certain fields of the synced resource(in this case, the one created in the virtual cluster) are propagated back to the original resource in the host cluster. Only the fields referenced in the `copyFromObject` reverse patch operations are propagated.
Both these fields follow the same syntax, as documented in [the "Patch syntax" chapter of this doc](#patch-syntax).


Example:
```yaml
sync:
  generic:
    config: |-
      version: v1beta1
      import:
        - kind: Secret
          apiVersion: v1
```

#### Patch syntax
The patch defines how will the vcluster behave when syncing each resource to and from the host cluster. Generally, a patch is defined by the field `path` and `op`(operation) that should be performed on said field.  
An array of `conditions` may also be set, and in such case, the field value will be modified by a patch only if the field value matches all the [conditions](#patch-conditions).  
Some operation types may utilize additional fields, and these will be explained in the next chapter.

| rewriteName                            |  V->H   | Replaces the contents of the `path` field with transformed content based on the namespace of the synced resource. This is typically done on the fields that refer to a resource name, and on the `.metadata.name` as well(implicit). This is done to avoid naming collisions when syncing resources to the host cluster, but it is not necessary when using the ["Multi-namespace mode"](#multi-namespace-mode).<br/> As an example, the "logstash" value of a resource in the "logging" namespace of the vcluster named "vc" is rewritten to "logstash-x-logging-x-vc". If the resulting length of the value would be over 63 characters, the last 10 characters will be replaced with a hash of the full value.                    |
| rewriteName + namePath + namespacePath |  V->H   | Similar to `rewriteName`, but with an addition of the `namePath` and/or `namespacePath`. This is used when a field of the synced resource is referencing a different resource via namespace and name via two separate fields. When using this option you would set the `path` to reference a field that is a common parent of both `namePath` and `namespacePath`, and these two fields would then contain just the relative path. For example, `path: spec.includes` + `namePath: name` + `namespacePath: namespace` for a resource that contains name in `spec.includes.name` and namespace in `spec.includes.namespace`.                                                                                                          |
| rewriteName + regex                    |  V->H   | Similar to `rewriteName`, but with an addition of the `regex` option for the patch. This is used when a string contains not just the resource name, but optionally a namespace,  and other characters. For example, a string containing "namespace/name" can be correctly rewritten with the addition of this configuration option - `regex: "$NAMESPACE/$NAME"`. The vcluster uses Go regular expressions to recognize the name part with the "NAME" capture group (can be written as `$NAME`), and the namespace with the "NAMESPACE" capture group (can be written as `$NAMESPACE`).                                                                                                                                              |
| rewriteLabelKey                        |  V->H   | The keys of the `.metadata.labels` of the synced resources are rewritten by vcluster and plugins. This patch type allows you to rewrite the key references in the same way, so the fields that are referencing labels will still reference correct labels in their rewritten form. For example, the label key-value pair "app: curl"  is rewritten to "vcluster.loft.sh/label-vcluster-x-a172cedcae: curl", so with this patch operation you can rewrite a field that contains "app" to "vcluster.loft.sh/label-vcluster-x-a172cedcae, and the controllers operating on the synced resources will work with this label just as expected. <br/>This is not necessary when using the ["Multi-namespace mode"].(#multi-namespace-mode). |
| rewriteLabelSelector                   |  V->H   | This operation exists for the same reasons as described for the rewriteLabelKey operation. It is intended to be used for the key-value map fields that represent a label selector. This patch operation will rewrite all keys in the field referenced by `path` to the expected format for the label keys, and it will also add additional key-value pairs(with virtual namespace and vcluster name) to avoid naming conflicts. <br/>This is not necessary when using the ["Multi-namespace mode"].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| rewriteLabelExpressionsSelector        |  V->H   | Similar to the `rewriteLabelSelector`, but expects `path` reference a field with the `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions` sub-fields, which will have the label keys rewritten just as described for `rewriteLabelKey`. <br/>This is not necessary when using the ["Multi-namespace mode"].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |


_V->H - patch operation is supported only for patches, or reverse patches, that are executed in the virtual to host direction._



**Example of various patch operations**  
The example below is a useful configuration for pushing service metrics into a Prometheus instance installed in the host cluster.  
You can refer to [ServiceMonitor spec documentation](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/operator/api/#monitoring.coreos.com/v1.ServiceMonitorSpec) to understand the example better.
```yaml
sync:
  generic:
    config: |-
      version: v1beta1
      export:
        - apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
          kind: ServiceMonitor
          patches:
            - op: add
              path: .metadata.labels
              value:
                prometheus-instance: default-instance
            - op: copyFromObject
              fromPath: .metadata.labels['prometheus-instance'] # could be omitted when equal to path
              path: .metadata.labels['prometheus-instance']
            - op: replace
              path: .spec.namespaceSelector
              value:
                any: false
                matchNames: []
            - op: rewriteName
              path: .spec.endpoints[*]
            - op: rewriteLabelKey
              path: .spec.jobLabel
            - op: rewriteLabelKey
              path: .spec.targetLabels[*]
            - op: rewriteLabelKey
              path: .spec.podTargetLabels[*]
            - op: rewriteLabelExpressionsSelector
              path: .spec.selector
            # A regex example, e.g. if we have a field in "namespace/name" string
            - op: rewriteName
              path: .metadata.annotations['custom-one-namespace-slash-name']
              regex: >
                ^$NAMESPACE/$NAME$
```

**Patch conditions**  
A patch can be applied conditionally by populating the `conditions` field of the patch definition. The condition will be checked either on a field referenced relative to the patch `path` via the `subPath` field of the condition or referenced as an absolute path in the synced resource via the `path` field of the condition.  
A condition can have one of these three fields set to check the value respectively:
- `equal` - either a scalar value or a complex object can be used
- `notEqual` - either a scalar value or a complex object can be used
- `empty` - a boolean (true or false) value
Examples:  
```yaml
...
patches:
	- op: add
		path: .metadata.labels
		value:
			prometheus-instance: default-instance
		conditions:
			- path: .metadata.labels['prometheus-instance']
				equal: "forbidden-instance"
	- op: copyFromObject
		fromPath: .metadata.labels['prometheus-instance'] # could be omitted when equal to path
		path: .metadata.labels['prometheus-instance']
		conditions:
			- subPath: "."
			  notEqual: "forbidden-instance"
	- op: add
		path: .metadata.labels
		value:
			mandatory: setIt
		conditions:
			- path: .metadata.labels['mandatory']
				empty: true

```

#### More Examples
A list of sample configurations can be found here - [vcluster generic-sync-examples](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/generic-sync-examples)

## Multi-namespace mode
In this mode vcluster diverges from the [architecture described previously](./basics.mdx). By default, all namespaced resources that need to be synced to the host cluster are created in the namespace where vcluster is installed. But in multi-namespace mode vcluster will create a namespace in the host cluster for each namespace in the virtual cluster. The namespace name is modified to avoid conflicts between multiple vcluster instances in the same host, but the synced namespaced resources are created with the same name as in the virtual cluster. To enable this mode use the following helm value:

```yaml
multiNamespaceMode:
  enabled: true
```

:::warning This mode must be enabled during vcluster creation.
Enabling, or disabling, it on an existing vcluster instance will force it into an inconsistent state.
:::

:::warning Alpha feature
Multi-namespace mode is currently in an alpha state. This is an advanced feature that requires more permissions in the host cluster, and as a result, it can potentially cause significant disruption in the host cluster.
