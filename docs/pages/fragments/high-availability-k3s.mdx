### Enabling High Availability

In order to run vCluster with k3s as Kubernetes distribution in high availability mode, the following steps are required:

* create and use an [external datastore](../deploying-vclusters/persistence.mdx) (as opposed to the embedded SQLite datastore used in single-server setups)
* run two or more k3s pods that will serve the Kubernetes API and run other control plane services

First create a `values.yaml` in the following form and make sure to change the connection string in `K3S_DATASTORE_ENDPOINT`:

```
syncer:
  replicas: 3

# Set external datastore endpoint
vcluster:
  env:
    - name: K3S_DATASTORE_ENDPOINT
      value: mysql://username:password@tcp(hostname:3306)/database-name

# Disable persistent storage as all data (including bootstrap data) is stored in external datastore
syncer:
  storage:
    persistence: false

# Scale up CoreDNS replicas
coredns:
  replicas: 2
```

Then create the vCluster with the following command:

```
vcluster create ... --connect=false -f values.yaml
```

Check that vCluster including the control plane is running correctly:

```
kubectl get pods -n vcluster
NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
coredns-66ffcc6b58-bhk4s-x-kube-system-x-vcluster   1/1     Running   0          21s
coredns-66ffcc6b58-n7npd-x-kube-system-x-vcluster   1/1     Running   0          21s
vcluster-54fb5dd76-92szq                            2/2     Running   0          3m1s
vcluster-54fb5dd76-ntbrh                            2/2     Running   0          3m1s
```

Now connect to the vCluster:

```
vcluster connect vcluster -n vcluster

# Then execute in a new terminal
export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl get ns
...
```
