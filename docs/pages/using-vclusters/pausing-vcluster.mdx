Pausing a vCluster means to temporarily scale down the vCluster and delete all its created workloads on the host cluster. This can be useful to save computing resources used by vCluster workloads in the host cluster. 

## Pausing a vCluster

In order to pause a vCluster, make sure you have the CLI installed and run the following command:

```
vcluster pause my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace
```

This command will do the following things:
1. Scale down the vCluster statefulset or deployment depending on which vCluster distro was used
2. Delete all the workloads created by vCluster

The command leaves the objects within the vCluster untouched, which means that even single pods that were deployed within the vCluster without a controlling replica set or statefulset will be restarted.

:::warning Temporary Filesystem of Pods erased
Since all the pods will be restarted, this also means that their temporary filesystem is erased as well as pod ip is changed.

## Resuming a vCluster

To resume a vCluster, make sure you have the CLI installed and run the following command:

```
vcluster resume my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace

# OR: connect to the vCluster to automatically resume it as well
vcluster connect my-vcluster
```

As soon as the vCluster is resumed, vCluster will scale up the paused statefulset or deployment and the vCluster syncer will recreate the vCluster pods.
