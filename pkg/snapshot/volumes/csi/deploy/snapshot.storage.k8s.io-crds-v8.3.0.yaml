                description: readyToUse indicates if the snapshot is ready to be used
                  to restore a volume. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field
                  will be filled in by the snapshot controller with the "ready_to_use"
                  value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshot" gRPC call. For a pre-existing
                  snapshot, this field will be filled with the "ready_to_use" value
                  returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports
                  it, otherwise, this field will be set to "True". If not specified,
                  it means the readiness of a snapshot is unknown.

              restoreSize:
                description: restoreSize represents the minimum size of volume required
                  to create a volume from this snapshot. In dynamic snapshot creation
                  case, this field will be filled in by the snapshot controller with
                  the "size_bytes" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshot" gRPC call.
                  For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the
                  "size_bytes" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call
                  if the driver supports it. When restoring a volume from this snapshot,
                  the size of the volume MUST NOT be smaller than the restoreSize
                  if it is specified, otherwise the restoration will fail. If not
                  specified, it indicates that the size is unknown.
